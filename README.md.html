# Project Electra

Project Electra is a rather complex multifaceted project dealing with, most simply put, electrical and electrochemical measurements. There are three Sub-Projects to Project Electra, however, only the first two will be made open-source and publicly available for a variety of reasons including the third's complexity, multi-field integration, primarily its potential for in its completed state to be a revolutionary commercial product, as well as a few other reasons. I would not suggest trying to devise what sub-project 3 is as it is ridiculously unlikely that even given Sub-Projects 1 & 2 knowledge Sub-Project 3 is related tangentially and non-linearly. 

## Project Electra Sub-Project One

Sub-Project One is by and far the most simple. It is a battery cycler project that can perform cycling using the constant current method (CC) or constant current constant voltage method (CC/CV) during battery testing. 

## Project Electra Sub-Project Two

Sub-Project Two is considerably more complex than Sub-Project One. To Start, it integrates several independent instruments and uses them in concert with one another. These instruments (or Sub-Systems) are the following:
Keithley 2400 High Accuracy Multimeter as well as either a Current or Voltage Source.
Keithley 2182A NanoVoltmeter
Keithley 6517A Electrometer / High Resistance Meter
Solartron 1260 Impedance Gain-Phase Analyzer
Solartron 1287 ElectroChemical Interface
Maccor Battery Cycler Model MC-4
Thermal Products Solutions Tenney Model TJR Thermal Isolation Chamber
Potentially Keithley 2700 Multimeter, Current or Voltage Source, and Data Acquisition Device

Other hardware and networking utilized includes the following:
